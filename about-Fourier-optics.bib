  abstract  = {Here we present a fast algorithm for Fresnel integral calculation. Some fast algorithms using the fast Fourier transform are analysed and their performance has been checked. These methods are of easy implementation, but are only valid for a specific range of distances. Fast algorithms based on the Fractional Fourier transform allow accurate evaluation of the Fresnel integral from object to Fraunhofer domain in a single step.},

Many of these high-speed diffraction algorithms based on a fast-Fourier-transformation are approximations of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld-diffraction (RSD) theory. In this article a novel sampling condition for the well-sampling of the Riemann integral of the RSD is demonstrated, the fundamental restrictions due to this condition are discussed, it will be demonstrated that the restrictions are completely removed by a sampling below the Abbe resolution limit and a very general unified approach for applying the RSD outside its sampling domain is given.},

This paper discusses more specifically the difficulties in ray-based methods and hybrid methods in which physical optics is encapsulated within a ray-based program. Phase singularities are common in physical optics analysis and are shown to pose severe difficulties for ray-based methods. Time-averaged, through- focus behavior of a clipped excimer beam is taken as an illustration of a problem which can not be solved by ray- based methods but is readily solved with the lensgroup operator method of Lawrence and Moore. Beam reshaping is taken as a second example where diffractive effects should be considered.},

Indeed, while previous works have presented results with super-resolution and field-of-view extrapolation, there are no well-established rules to determine them. We show that the theoretical field of view can be large with a spatial-frequency bandwidth only limited by the wavelength, leading to an unthinkable number of degrees of freedom. To keep a realistic field of view and bandwidth, we propose several practical bounds based on a few setup properties, namely, the noise level and spatio-temporal coherence of the source.},

The validity limits of the proposed algorithm are explored. Analytical expressions, numerical simulation results, and experimental data are compared.},
